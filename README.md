## Profiles
A profile represents metadata regarding a person's closet. This includes all the different pieces of clothing / accessories a person has. This also contains a representation of which clothes go with which other clothes.

Each clothing item / accesory is given an item ID and this is used as a shared key as well as the name of the corresponding image file.
